# Presence Days Calculator

This is a Windows Forms application that calculates the number of days required for students in my class to be present.

The reason behind this tool is based on rules from my class at Lutz + Grub Academy for IT Specialist: Application Development. According to the German IHK, students must be present in the classroom for **at least 51%** of the class days. The remaining 49% can be attended remotely or done via homework. 

This application allows users to enter their attendance data for each month, calculates how many days theyâ€™ve been present, and how many they still need in order to qualify for the final exams. A **save and load** feature ensures users donâ€™t lose their data.

*To launch the application, start `Presence Days Calculator.exe` located in `(~...)\bin\Release\net7.0\`.*

This tool was made for my **personal use**, mainly to improve my C# skills. Surprisingly, it turned out to be quite helpful. No more manual notes or forgetting how many days I still need to be present.

It has been made in **C#â€™s Windows Forms**, by someone who is aspiring to become a real programmer someday. ðŸ˜Š
